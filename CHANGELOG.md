All notable changes to OMNIcode will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added (Phase A + B: type system parity with canonical Python omnicc, 2026-05-13)
- **`Value::HFloat(f64)`** variant in the runtime. Float literals (`1.5`) now stay as floats instead of being truncated to `HInt`. Arithmetic and comparisons auto-promote when either operand is `HFloat`. Adds `Value::to_float()` and `Value::is_float()` / `Value::is_numeric()` helpers.
- **`Statement::Parameter`** AST variant + interpreter handler — needed for the Python-canonical parser model where function parameters bind through a separate AST node.
- **`phi.X` module-qualified call syntax.** Parser consumes `Token::Dot` after identifiers and joins module + method into a single name (`"phi.fold"`). Keywords like `res`/`fold` are accepted after a dot. Interpreter routes `phi.X` through `call_module_function`:
  - `phi.fold(x)` — single-arg snap to nearest Fibonacci
  - `phi.fold(x, depth)` — depth is any expression, not just a literal (resolves a Phase 18 gotcha)
  - `phi.res(x)` — returns HFloat resonance score
  - `phi.him(x)` — returns HFloat HIM score
  - Unknown modules fall through to the unqualified name (so `core.fib(n)` works after `import core;` without per-module setup)
- **Pragma annotations** — both forms used by canonical mining code:
  - Line-prefix `@pragma[hbit]` above `fn` (up to N stacked)
  - Postfix `-> int @hbit @register` after return type
  - Currently parsed and stored; semantic lowering (AVX2 / register hints) deferred to a future phase.
- **Parameter type annotations** — `fn add(x: int, y: int) -> int { ... }`. Parsed into `param_types: Vec<Option<String>>` on `Statement::FunctionDef`; ignored semantically for now.
- **Variadic `fold()` and `res()`** — `fold(x, "fibonacci")` and `fold(x, depth)` patterns now parse (previously hard-coded as single-arg special forms).

### Compatibility
- `examples/miner_nuclear.omc` from the canonical Python OMNIcode tree now runs end-to-end on the Rust interpreter (131 lines, 7 stacked pragmas, typed params, variadic fold).
- Test count: **72 passing** (was 51 before Phase A) — 7 new HFloat/phi.X tests in Phase A, 4 new pragma/type-annotation tests in Phase B.

### Changed (Interpreter consolidation, 2026-05-13)
- **Single canonical interpreter.** Merged the orphaned `src/` tree into `omnimcode-core/src/`. There is now one interpreter codebase serving the standalone binary, the C FFI, the Python module, and Godot.
- **`standalone.omc`** is now a symlink to `target/release/omnimcode-standalone` (the binary defined by `omnimcode-core`'s `[[bin]]` entry). The old `target/release/standalone` build target no longer exists.
- **Float circuit gates** (FloatConstant, FloatInput, FloatWeightedSum, Sigmoid, FloatMultiply, FloatAdd, PhiFold) are now available everywhere — previously these existed only in the orphan `src/` tree and didn't actually compile.
- **`build.sh`** updated to refresh the `standalone.omc` symlink instead of copying the old `target/release/standalone`.
- **`VERIFICATION.sh`** updated for the new paths and binary name; test count is now computed dynamically rather than hardcoded.

### Fixed
- Non-exhaustive `Circuit::to_dot()` match arm for the new Float gate variants.
- `u32 → usize` type mismatch in `create_random_circuit`'s `PhiFold` depth.

### Docs
- Archived 34 historical / tier-completion / phase-summary / HBit-bugfix-narrative files to `docs/archive/`. Root keeps 18 canonical living docs.
- Updated path references throughout (`src/*.rs` → `omnimcode-core/src/*.rs`), binary name (`standalone` → `omnimcode-standalone`), test count (now **72/72**), and binary size (~544 KB).
- Clarified dependency claims — runtime is libc-only, but `regex` and `thiserror` are statically linked compile-time deps.

### Tests
- **72/72 passing** across the workspace (68 core + 1 standalone + 2 FFI + 1 Python). Previously the 49/51 counts in docs were partial or stale.
