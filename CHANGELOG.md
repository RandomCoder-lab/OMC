# Changelog

All notable changes to OMNIcode will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed (Interpreter consolidation, 2026-05-13)
- **Single canonical interpreter.** Merged the orphaned `src/` tree into `omnimcode-core/src/`. There is now one interpreter codebase serving the standalone binary, the C FFI, the Python module, and Godot.
- **`standalone.omc`** is now a symlink to `target/release/omnimcode-standalone` (the binary defined by `omnimcode-core`'s `[[bin]]` entry). The old `target/release/standalone` build target no longer exists.
- **Float circuit gates** (FloatConstant, FloatInput, FloatWeightedSum, Sigmoid, FloatMultiply, FloatAdd, PhiFold) are now available everywhere — previously these existed only in the orphan `src/` tree and didn't actually compile.
- **`build.sh`** updated to refresh the `standalone.omc` symlink instead of copying the old `target/release/standalone`.
- **`VERIFICATION.sh`** updated for the new paths and binary name; test count is now computed dynamically rather than hardcoded.

### Fixed
- Non-exhaustive `Circuit::to_dot()` match arm for the new Float gate variants.
- `u32 → usize` type mismatch in `create_random_circuit`'s `PhiFold` depth.

### Docs
- Archived 34 historical / tier-completion / phase-summary / HBit-bugfix-narrative files to `docs/archive/`. Root keeps 18 canonical living docs.
- Updated path references throughout (`src/*.rs` → `omnimcode-core/src/*.rs`), binary name (`standalone` → `omnimcode-standalone`), test count (now **72/72**), and binary size (~544 KB).
- Clarified dependency claims — runtime is libc-only, but `regex` and `thiserror` are statically linked compile-time deps.

### Tests
- **72/72 passing** across the workspace (68 core + 1 standalone + 2 FFI + 1 Python). Previously the 49/51 counts in docs were partial or stale.
